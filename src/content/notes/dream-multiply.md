## Challenge Overview

This challenge provided a short Python script idog.py along with a meme image. At first glance the image suggested a joke multiplication problem, but the code revealed a deeper puzzle involving a custom multiplication function and AES decryption.

When executed, the script:

* Prompts for an *8-digit number* x and a *7-digit number* y.
* Enforces two constraints:

  1. x * y must not equal 381404224402842 (the “meme” product shown in the image).
  2. A custom check: dream_multiply(x, y) == x * y.
* Uses (x, y) to derive an AES key via
  sha256(str((x, y)).encode()).digest().
* Decrypts a fixed ciphertext under AES-ECB and prints the flag.

## Key Observations (Understanding the Mechanism)

1. *dream_multiply logic*
   The function concatenates digit-wise products instead of doing true multiplication:

   
   digits = x[0] | (x[1]*y[0]) | (x[2]*y[1]) | ... | (x[7]*y[6])
   

   This string, when interpreted as an integer, must equal the real product x * y.

2. *Digit constraints from product length*
   An 8-digit number multiplied by a 7-digit number yields a 14–15 digit product.
   For the concatenated string to match, nearly all digit-pair products must be *two digits* (≥10).
   This prunes the search space significantly:

   * If x[i] = 2, then y[i-1] ≥ 5.
   * If x[i] = 3, then y[i-1] ≥ 4.
   * For x[i] ≥ 5, even y[i-1] = 2 is enough.

3. *Exclusion of the obvious pair*
   The assertion banning 381404224402842 ensured we couldn’t just plug in the meme numbers.

4. *AES-ECB with SHA-256 key*
   Once a valid (x, y) is found, the AES key is deterministic:

   
   key = sha256(b"(x, y)").digest()
   

   Only the correct (x, y) yields a meaningful plaintext flag.


## Exploitation (Finding (x, y))

### Step 1 — Constraints

We required:

* x has 8 digits, y has 7 digits.
* dream_multiply(x, y) == x * y.
* Each digit pair x[i] * y[i-1] must yield two digits to keep the concatenation length consistent.

### Step 2 — Reasoning and Brute Force

While it was possible to reason about digit-by-digit possibilities, the more reliable path was to *brute force with pruning*:

* For each possible digit in x[1..7], restrict y’s digits according to the ≥10 rule above.
* Construct candidate x and y pairs.
* Verify the equality dream_multiply(x,y) == x*y.

> Community hints (such as Reddit threads) also pointed toward brute force being a viable and intended approach.

### Step 3 — Solution Pair

The correct pair was discovered:


x = 49228443
y = 9773647


Verification:

* dream_multiply(49228443, 9773647) = 481141424241621
* 49228443 * 9773647 = 481141424241621

They match exactly, satisfying the condition.

### Step 4 — Decryption

With (x, y) fixed, compute:


key = sha256(b"(49228443, 9773647)").digest()


Decrypting the provided ciphertext under AES-ECB with this key yields:


Here is your flag: SEKAI{iSOgenni_in_mY_D1234M5;_iS_it_T00_s00n}


## Running It End-to-End

bash
$ python3 -O idog.py
Enter an 8-digit multiplicand: 49228443
Enter a 7-digit multiplier: 9773647
Here is your flag: SEKAI{iSOgenni_in_mY_D1234M5;_iS_it_T00_s00n}

## Final Flag


sekai{iSOgenni_in_mY_D1234M5;_iS_it_T00_s00n}


## Neat!

* It disguised a real math + crypto puzzle behind a meme.
* It forced you to either reason digit-by-digit or brute force cleverly, both valid approaches.
* It tied the math to a cryptographic primitive (AES-ECB with SHA-256 keying), providing a clean final check.
* Online hints nudged solvers toward brute force, but understanding the digit constraints provided insight into why the brute force works.
